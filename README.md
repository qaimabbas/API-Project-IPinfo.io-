# API-Project-IPinfo.io.

An application in PHP that would be run from the command line (CLI). When it is run it should make an HTTP call to IPInfo API (this API works without auth
token) and depending on input argument would either:

1)store the obtained data in a JSON file (file path should come from CLI argument);
2)display that information in CLI in nicely formatted table.
